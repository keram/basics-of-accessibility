#+BEGIN_QUOTE

It is expensive and hard to do.

#+END_QUOTE

Well, this is true when you take accessibility into consideration only in the final phase of a project(s) or try to retrofit to an existing application.

frontend developers, managers..

Explanation:

Checklists and automated tools are usefull and recommended, but can not replace testing
and experience of real users.

*How not to do it:*

We wish to include on our website nice picture.

#+attr_html: :width 50%
[[./assets/xxx.jpeg]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

<img src="xxx.png" />

#+END_EXAMPLE

And you heard that to make it accessible we need to add "alt" attribute.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

<img src="xxx.png" alt="Image" />

#+END_EXAMPLE


The correct way:


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

<img src="xxx.png" alt="Woman on the beach excercising yoga" />

#+END_EXAMPLE

*Add an alternative description of the information displayed by the picture.*

\\
\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

*Accessibility is about the details that you may not notice or ever use but
are critical to many users.*

#+END_QUOTE

\\
\\
\\
\\

* Why Should (We / You) Care?

 - *Ethical reasons and because it is the right thing to do*

\\
\\
\\
\\
\\

\\
\\

 - Law and legal requirements

* Implementation Patterns or Live Examples

In land where accessibility is responsibility of everyone,
it also crucial that there is someone primarly responsible.

*One most recurring pattern in companies that successfully implement inclusion and accessibility into
their products and company culture is that at least one person from higher management is able put his neck into the line.*

* Conclusion


#+BEGIN_QUOTE

"100% accessibility" is an unobtainable ideal — you will always come across some kind of edge case that results in a certain user finding certain content difficult to use — but you should do as much as you can.
